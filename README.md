# TriviaGame
This project is a trivia quiz game based on Apple Inc.

This project was designed and built by Mike Mooney using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and jQuery.

The player is presented with a start screen on which they must click a button to begin the quiz. They are then shown a list of 8 trivia questions about Apple, and a 3 minute timer begins to run down. 
If the player finishes the quiz before the timer finishes, they can submit their answers using a button at the bottom of the page, which brings them to an answer review page.
If the player does not finish the quiz before the timer finishes, they are brought to the answer review screen automatically.
The answer review screen shows the player how many questions they answered correctly, incorrectly, and how many questions they missed.
The player has the option to restart the quiz on this page without refreshing the browser by pressing the Try Again button.

The project is web-based and can be played in most web browsers.
